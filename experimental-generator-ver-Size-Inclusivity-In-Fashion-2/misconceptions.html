          <h2>1. Having plus-size lines does not equate to complete size inclusivity in fashion.</h2>

          <p class="content">For a brand or retailer to truly be considered size inclusive, it should offer sizes from a range of petite to fat. Every fashion line should be available to all body types, and that simply doesn't happen when clothing is separated into plus-sized and straight-sized lines. To be truly inclusive to plus-sized people, brands should steer away from plus-sized collections and focus on expanding their standard sizing range instead.

        <div class="misconception2">
          <h2>2. It is not enough for a brand to simply enlarge its existing straight-size design patterns when expanding sizing.</h2>

          <p class="content">The same cuts that flatter straight-size people will most likely not compliment other sizes as well. In order to truly provide quality clothing for a wide size range, a brand should revisit the design board to create new clothing patterns that will flatter each body type every time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="misconception3">
          <h2>3. Fat does not mean inactive.</h2>

          <p class="content">Many brands make the mistake of assuming that if a person is fat, then they must also be inactive. These brands then purposefully create workout clothing lines for body types that are stereotypically considered athletic and ignore others. However, fat people do participate in athletic activities and deserve the same comfortable, stylish workout clothes that are provided to other body types as a matter of course.
